61. Grid Sizing

How to size columns and rows to conform to our design
grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns: can be set to specific sizes
these will be non-responsive
sizes can be px & rem
instead of grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns, you can use grid-template: define rows first / define columns after the forward slash
another way to define size is to use auto  (eg. 100px <the first row> auto is the second column) The second column can be as wide or narrow as it needs to take up the full width of the screen
using auto in rows means that it will fit content not the screen size.
using auto in columns means it will fit the window, not the content
fractional sizing (1fr 2fr)
the fr (fractional unit) defines the size of the element(row or column) by a fraction
(e.g. 1fr 2fr - means that the element will grow or shrink as needed with the first element being ⅓ of the window width or height and the second element being ⅔ of the width or height.
responsive minmax
eg. grid-template-columns: 200px minmax(400px, 800px)
this means that the second column will go to a minimum of 400px and a max of 800px.
how to do repeated fr by using the repeat function
eg (grid-template-rows: repeat (8, 100px);
grid-auto-rows: 300px controls styling no matter how many items in each div
